<h2>Description</h2>
A High Consequence Event (HCE) in the Food and Agriculture sector refers to a scenario where critical infrastructures—like grain storage, irrigation systems, or distribution centers—are compromised, leading to severe disruptions in the food supply chain. Such an event could cause widespread food shortages, economic instability, and public health crises.
Creating and understanding an HCE helps identify vulnerabilities, enhances preparedness, and informs decision-making. It enables proactive risk management, ensuring that early detection systems and cost-effective defense measures are in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these high-risk scenarios.
